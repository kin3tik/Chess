=====================================

##Controls

* Press '1' on the keyboard to have the pieces on the board represented graphically (with pictures)
* Press '2' on the keyboard to have the pieces on the board represented textually
* Press 'l' on the keyboard to load a file containing a board layout (must be in sketch directory)
* Press 's' on the keyboard to save a file containing a board layout

##Notes

* Comes with 2 pre made files to load. 'smile.txt' and 'standard'.

###Only in Console View

* When a piece is captured the console displays a message saying what was captured
* If the user tries to load a file that does not exist, the console will notify the user

###Other

* not implemented to the user, and not tested, but the game can be 'zoomed' by changing the SCALESIZE variable
* The piece move is animated by following the mouse when selected
